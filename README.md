List of English words
This is meant to include all English words I can collect, whether or not I now what they mean or know that they are actually words. The goal is to find out how many words I know, as an N=1 sample of how many words people know. Past guesses have ranged from 600 to 10,000 (typical estimate before the computer era) to 100,000 (typical estimate now) to 1,000,000 (mine).  At the higher end, the estimates depend greatly on the definition of "word," which I am not yet trying to establish.
